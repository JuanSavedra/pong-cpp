# Gemini Project: pong-cpp

This document provides a summary of the `pong-cpp` project, its structure, and how to build and run it.

## Project Overview

This is a C++ project that implements a simple Pong game.

*   **Language:** C++
*   **Graphics:** OpenGL
*   **Windowing:** GLFW
*   **Build System:** CMake

The project is structured with a main `Game` class that encapsulates the game logic, including initialization, the game loop, and rendering. Dependencies like GLFW are fetched automatically during the CMake configuration process using `FetchContent`.

## Building and Running

To build and run the project, you will need a C++ compiler, CMake, and Git installed.

1.  **Configure the project:**
    Create a build directory and run CMake from the project root. This will download dependencies and generate the build files.
    ```bash
    cmake -B build
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    Compile the project using the build files generated by CMake.
    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    The executable, named `pong-cpp`, will be located in the `build/pong-cpp` directory.
    ```bash
    ./build/pong-cpp/pong-cpp
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The code is written in an object-oriented style. The main game logic is contained within the `Game` class.
*   **Game Loop:** The core logic follows a standard `init()`, `update()`, `render()` game loop pattern.
*   **Headers:** Header files use `#ifndef` include guards.
*   **Dependencies:** C++ dependencies are managed by CMake's `FetchContent` where possible.
