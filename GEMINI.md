# Gemini Project: pong-cpp

This document provides a summary of the `pong-cpp` project, its structure, and how to build and run it.

## Project Overview

This is a C++ project that implements a simple Pong game.

*   **Language:** C++
*   **Graphics:** OpenGL
*   **Windowing:** GLFW
*   **Math:** GLM
*   **Build System:** CMake

The project is structured with a main `Game` class that encapsulates the game logic. Dependencies like GLFW and GLM are fetched automatically during the CMake configuration process using `FetchContent`.

## Building and Running

To build and run the project, you will need a C++ compiler, CMake, and Git installed.

1.  **Configure the project:**
    Create a build directory and run CMake from the project root. This will download dependencies and generate the build files.
    ```bash
    cmake -B build
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    Compile the project using the build files generated by CMake. This will also copy the `res` directory with shaders to the executable's directory.
    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    The executable, named `pong-cpp`, will be located in the `build/pong-cpp` directory. Run it from the project root.
    ```bash
    ./build/pong-cpp/pong-cpp
    ```

## Code Structure

### Core Classes

*   **`Game`**: The main class that drives the application. It's responsible for:
    *   Initializing GLFW, GLAD, and the game window.
    *   Managing the main game loop (`run`).
    *   Processing user input (`processInput`).
    *   Updating game state (`update`).
    *   Rendering the scene (`render`).
    *   It owns the `Player` and `Shader` objects.

*   **`Player`**: Represents a player's paddle. It is intended to manage the player's position and movement in response to input. The game logic suggests a grid-based movement system.

*   **`Shader`**: A utility class for loading, compiling, and linking GLSL shaders. It reads shader source from files, checks for compilation errors, and provides an interface to set uniform variables.

### Shaders

The project uses a simple shader pair:
*   `racket.vert`: A basic pass-through vertex shader.
*   `racket.frag`: A simple fragment shader that colors fragments with a single uniform color.

### Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The code is written in an object-oriented style.
*   **Game Loop:** The core logic follows a standard `init()`, `update()`, `render()` game loop pattern.
*   **Dependencies:** C++ dependencies are managed by CMake's `FetchContent`.
*   **Resources:** Game resources like shaders are located in the `pong-cpp/res` directory and are automatically copied to the build output directory.
